# Introduction

Stapifaction is a framework designed to make it trivial to persist Rust data
structures to [static APIs](https://www.seancdavis.com/posts/lets-talk-about-static-apis/).
At its core, Stapifaction design allows you to easily specify into what folders and files
you want to persist your existing data structures, using `#[derive]` attributes.

If you choose to persist your structs to JSON files (using the default `json` feature), 
[Serde](https://serde.rs/) is used behind the scenes.
