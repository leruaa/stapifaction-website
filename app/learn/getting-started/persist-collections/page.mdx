# Persist collections

How about persisting not only a single struct but all item in a collection? Just add the
`ToJsonIterable` trait in scope to add `to_json()` to collections. By default each collection
item will be persisted using the index as the file name, but this can be customized with the
`#[persistable(id)]` attribute on a struct field, as in the example below.

<CodeFiles code={<CollectionExample />} files={<Files  files={{"users": ["ehdz.json", "ioeq.json", "wqpf.json"]}} />} />
