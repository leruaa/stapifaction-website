# First example

Let's start by writing a very basic program persisiting a struct. In the
following example, we use the default `json` feature to serialize the `User`
struct to a JSON file, using [Serde].

<CodeFiles code={<BasicExample />} files={<Files files={{".": ["data.json"]}} />} />

Running the code above will create a <code>./data.json</code> file. You can
have a look at the [supported Serde attributes] if you want to customize how
structs are serialized.
